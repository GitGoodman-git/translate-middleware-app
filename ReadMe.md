This is a mini-project :)

Why? Well one day i was browsing through rapid-api and thought Mmm lets just make an interface for google translate api and add sign in oauth and other cool stuff to the app.Its kinda useless from a use-case POV 

Whats Next? As I was thinking about how needless this was,I thought what would be a more helpful extension to this.And I am thinking of expanding this into a api interface aid and deployment platform project, like Wix but a lil more specific.

What did i get from this mini?I practiced my newly developed MERN(i will show my React skills later) skills and built an idea into reality.Pretty cool,yeah i will keep doing more cool stuff. 

To the readers:
  Do advise me on any strategies that i should/could have implemented to improve the robustness,outlook,performance etc.

  Your support,advice,criticism etc. are all very appreciated ^-^
  
  Have a nice day.
